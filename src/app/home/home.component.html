      <p>If you want to boost your health and wellbeing, there are plenty of natural and home remedies to try. <br>
      When it comes to knowing whatâ€™s healthy, even qualified experts often seem to hold opposing opinions. This can make it difficult to figure out what you should actually be doing to optimize your health. <br>
      Hydration is an important and often overlooked marker of health. Staying hydrated helps ensure that your body is functioning optimally and that your blood volume is sufficient (34Trusted Source).

      Drinking water is the best way to stay hydrated, as it's free of calories, sugar, and additives.
      
      Although there's no set amount that everyone needs per day, aim to drink enough so that your thirst is adequately quenched</p>
